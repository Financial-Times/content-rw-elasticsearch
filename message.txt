Bernanke says they are prepared to do more if conditions warrant it, but if there was a sudden disruption in financial markets tomorrow, they wouldn’t even know which policy option to prefer. I expected better than this from Bernanke and the rest of the Fed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t think that’s fair. I think the Fed knows exactly what it would do if there was a sudden disruption in financial markets tomorrow: liquidity programmes like those we saw during the crisis and then probably asset purchases if they didn’t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the Fed is still pondering for a few reasons. First, the best response would depend on the conditions at the time, e.g. asset purchases will deliver better results if markets are stressed and the effect of communications will depend on the yield curve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, the FOMC is quite split about the effectiveness of asset purchases, how much they distort markets, and the risks to the Fed’s credibility.

This move, which we view as a “backwards step”, is the latest in a salvo of proposals to curb engaged investors. But it is also part of a broader debate about the perceived short-termism in markets, the weaknesses in corporate governance and the role of \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Investor_activism\"\u003eactivists\u003c/a\u003e which policymakers, boardrooms and investors wrestle with. That’s why we organised a summit this week to debate the merits and demerits of taking a long-term perspective and market-based solutions. I for one will be looking to praise, not bury, activist investors. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe history of short-termism is a long one. Keynes in the 1930s called short-termism a “contemporary evil”. From the pioneering “proxyteers” of the 1950s through the Barbarians at the Gate in the 1980s, to today’s activists, companies have often bemoaned engaged shareholders who have agitated for change. It remains true today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, bosses perceive that short-termism is more acute than ever. A recent study commissioned by think-tank Focusing Capital on the Long Term suggested 87 per cent of executives felt pressure to deliver results within two years or less. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pressure on executive teams is indeed high. But in our experience it is the disruptive impact of technology and its intersection with the big macro challenges of globalisation, political uncertainty and the scars of the financial crisis, which are often the root cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second concern is that a large proportion of investors are focused on short-term returns. But it is hard to find systematic evidence of short-termism in markets. While plenty of investors are looking to trade small movements or focus on merger arbitrage, the vast weight of money is looking for long-term value. The valuations of tech giants or biotech stocks affirms that markets do value long-term earnings power and try to value the optionality inherent in such innovative sectors. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next complaint is that companies are underinvesting to boost short-term profits. The normal statistic trotted out is that buy backs and dividends are now higher than earnings or Research \u0026amp; Development in the US. But when you look more closely you see that R\u0026amp;D has stayed fairly constant as a percentage of GDP and percentage of sales. Rather companies are returning cash as the windfall gains of incredibly cheap borrowing costs due to quantitative easing is being handed back to shareholders. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePut another way, QE has not been as effective as the central bankers’ fair weather models suggested. Companies are simply not seeing a wide range of \u003ccontent id=\"48335160-5265-11e7-a1f2-db19572361bb\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003enew investment opportunities \u003c/content\u003ejust because of cheap money. Moreover, QE also means investors are yield hungry and so nudge companies to up their payouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA more compelling concern is the rising share of passive investing risks creating a swath of absentee landlords with less check on poor management teams. Given passive investing is likely to breach half of US equities fund investments in the next 12 months and well over one quarter in Europe, some are becoming more apprehensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there are many tensions and stakeholders running a public company, some management teams are too focused on gilding their cage. Others underemphasise the long-term sustainability of their firms beyond their tenure, get stuck on the treadmill of quarterly reporting or simply chase poorly designed incentive schemes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo who is going to solve this? Rather than passing new laws, we should welcome activist and engaged investors which can be an important catalyst for change. The best academic study on activism suggests activists are not myopic. Harvard’s Lucian Bebchuk and colleagues\u003ca href=\"https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/01/26/dealing-with-activist-hedge-funds-and-other-activist-investors/\"\u003e looked at 2000 interventions by activists \u003c/a\u003ewhich showed that five years after activist intervention, their operating performance was materially improved. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is not to say there aren’t short-term activists, or that all engaged investors proposals are good. There are virtues and vices in short and long-termism. Rather the devil is in the detail and idealism needs to be married with deep pragmatism. A keen focus on appropriate incentives and corporate governance is a critical ingredient. But so too is a pluralistic market for financing the economy: private and public markets; passive and activist investors. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI often suspect companies get the shareholders they deserve. Those who are not sufficiently focused on driving long-term value and the sustainability of their business ironically make themselves more vulnerable to the activists they fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e","brands":[{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"}],"byline":"Huw van

One factor is education: as the authors of \u003cem\u003eWinning the War For Talent\u003c/em\u003e point out, women in emerging markets are graduating from universities and graduate schools at rates that match and often outstrip those of men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFamily and tradition can work to women’s advantage. In China, and in countries of the former Soviet Union, women’s participation in the labour force has been encouraged; in conservative societies close-knit extended families and affordable help can make it easier for women to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe need for women to contribute to the household income has been a driver of ambition – but more jobs also have been available. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaadia Zahidi, head of gender parity and human capital at the World Economic Forum, says: “If you have large, fast-growing companies – say you go from 50 to 500 posts [in a company] – the need for talent overcomes barriers that may exist.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutional backing for working women has also helped, with growing support for remote working arrangements, flexible hours and paid maternity leave. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImposing quotas can be less controversial than in Europe. Ms Lagerberg says more and more business leaders in emerging markets say they back board quotas for women. “It’s telling that people engaged in this are beginning to see where it should go. It might be that quotas come in several years’ time, but business leaders are becoming more conscious about process,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is still a long way to go. And the risk is that the progress achieved so far will not be accelerated as \u003ca href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/indepth/emerging-markets-in-retreat\" title=\"Emerging markets in retreat in depth - FT.com\"\u003egrowth in emerging economies begins to slow\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar too many women still face social pressures to leave their jobs after having children; their entrepreneurial drive is also stifled by constrained access to credit. The wage gap should also narrow. Even if they might receive equal pay to men when they join the labour force, women find the disparity widens as they move up the organisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs Lagerberg cites the need for more role models and mentoring to push women up the corporate ladder. “The more you see senior women in role modelling positions, the more you inspire others to come through. You need [mentoring] programmes with a specific diversity element.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther experts warn that improvements at the top do not necessarily mean pro­gress at the bottom. The picture for senior women in emerging markets may be brighter than in the west, but women’s participation in the labour force is lower than in Europe or the US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs Zahidi says that in rapidly growing economies such as Brazil, China and Indonesia, women are joining the labour force at relatively faster rates than men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in India, women’s participation in the workforce has risen only 4 per cent, to 34 per cent, in the past eight years. “In India, a policy was just passed [which means] all publicly listed companies have to have one female director on board …and there’s a trend to get more women in leadership positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But this is also the country where a lot of the poverty and illiteracy is concentrated among females,” Ms Zahidi says. “Because of cultural implications you see a divergence between low- and high-income women.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e——————————————-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ccontent data-embedded=\"true\" id=\"904d4072-a404-11e3-16d6-978e959e1c97\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\"\u003e\u003c/content\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eChanda Kochhar, chief executive, ICICI Bank\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Change will be driven as much from an economic as from a social perspective.

But after a nine-month\u003ccontent id=\"6fdca33c-b54a-11e1-ad93-00144feabdc0\" title=\"HKEx agrees to buy LME for £1.4bn - FT.com\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003e race to acquire the London Metal Exchange\u003c/content\u003e, shareholders of Hong Kong Exchanges \u0026amp; Clearing may be less than jubilant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a price of £1.39bn, it would take 180 years for HKEx to recoup its investment if the 135-year-old exchange carries on earning at last year’s rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clearly, from a multiple on current earnings this is a tough one to defend,” says Alex Kramm, exchanges analyst at UBS. A person close to the bid concedes: “On conventional metrics it’s pretty scary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, the LME has had no shortage of suitors willing to pay up. Behind HKEx, Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange was bidding just below £1.3bn, while CME Group, \u003ccontent id=\"0cd04c1e-a404-11e1-8878-00144feabdc0\" title=\"CME knocked out of race for LME - FT.com\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003eknocked out last month\u003c/content\u003e, was also willing to pay more than £1bn, according to people familiar with the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everybody who is anybody in the commodities exchanges [industry] has been around this price,” Charles Li, chief executive of HKEx, told the Financial Times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desire to buy the LME is in part strategic: as one of the last member-owned exchanges in the world, and the undisputed centre for global metals trading, the LME has long been coveted by the industry’s heavyweights. “It is a strategic asset. A lot of people wanted this business,” says a person close to the HKEx bid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut HKEx must still show it can make money from the LME, which is currently run, as one veteran puts it, “like a golf club – for the benefit of the members”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderlying the valuation lies a conviction that HKEx can transform the LME from a clubby institution into a significant driver of its profits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of the process has begun, with a plan to raise fees, which will lift last year’s profits from £7.7m to £23.8m according to HKEx, and to bring clearing in-house, which could add about £20m to earnings, analysts say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that is not enough alone to justify the price HKEx will pay – if LME shareholders and UK regulators approve the deal. The key to the Hong Kong group’s bid for the LME is a big bet on China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe country is the largest consumer of metals traded on the LME, but few Chinese companies can access the exchange. The LME only recently approved the country’s first member, Bank of China, and HKEx estimates that only 20-25 per cent of trades on the LME originate from China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Substantial trading and hedging needs from Asia are not currently met through the system,” says Mr Li.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo address that, HKEx would launch a suite of new services tailored for the Chinese market, in particular allowing Chinese traders to clear their trades during the Asian day, instead of having to wait until early afternoon in London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/global-renminbi\" title=\"Special report - Renminbi: Global Challenge - FT.com\"\u003einternationalisation of the renminbi\u003c/a\u003e would also be a boost. This allows HKEx to launch clearing, and later trading, of metals in the Chinese currency, with huge flows through Hong Kong and HKEx using the LME as “another net to catch fish”, as one person close to the bid said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomnesh Lamba, HKEx’s head of market development and a key architect of the deal, said: “To us clearing is not just about a revenue and income stream. It’s not a huge component of the valuation but it’s really important to facilitating China and new products.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHKEx plans to launch new products – of which coking coal, used for steelmaking, and stainless steel are likely to be priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all that, some remain sceptical. Investors are losing their enthusiasm for the “\u003ccontent id=\"099cf10e-a964-11e1-9772-00144feabdc0\" title=\"A less-super commodities supercycle - FT.com\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003ecommodities supercycle\u003c/content\u003e”, which could lead to a fall in trading volumes. So could higher interest rates, which reduce traders’ ability to make large trades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenneth Worthington, analyst at JPMorgan, values the LME at $1.9bn on the most bullish assumptions. “As they pay a higher and higher price, the margin for error continues to go down and the risk is increasingly borne by the bidder’s rather than LME’s shareholders,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, HKEx’s shares have fallen about 25 per cent since February, in part over concern that it would overpay for the LME. On Friday, shares in ICE, the other finalist in the LME bidding war, jumped nearly 5 per cent, amid relief that it had not been successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut HKEx executives were triumphant on Friday night at a cocktail party to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the exchange’s listing on its own market. They were unconcerned about any reduction in HKEx’s earnings over the next two years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is not going to happen overnight,” said Mr Li. “But we are highly confident”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAdditional reporting by Robert Cookson in Hong Kong and Jeremy Grant in

By channelling attention and making decisions on behalf of their users, virtual assistants will have enormous power to make or break many other businesses. Many companies — from carmakers to entertainment concerns — aim to develop voice-powered assistants of their own to keep their customers loyal. But the future may belong instead to a handful of all-knowing assistants, much as Google’s search engine managed to suck in so many of the world’s queries on the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough it has not reached the point of mass adoption yet, the potential of this new form of artificial intelligence has all the tech companies scrambling. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with \u003cconcept id=\"0b09e7fb-d889-3879-a1c2-2dd0272943e3\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/PublicCompany\"\u003eMicrosoft\u003c/concept\u003e, they include \u003cconcept id=\"2384fa7a-d514-3d6a-a0ea-3a711f66d0d8\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/PublicCompany\"\u003eApple\u003c/concept\u003e, with the Siri question-and-answer service on its iPhones and iPads, \u003cconcept id=\"410dd646-0e14-3e4a-83ea-732bed4a1453\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/PublicCompany\"\u003eGoogle\u003c/concept\u003e, whose Google Now service tries to anticipate its users’ information needs, as well as \u003cconcept id=\"36d2852b-1cb9-3c71-936e-8d755747048f\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/PublicCompany\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/concept\u003e, \u003cconcept id=\"23629959-5137-384a-a8af-3f7d9cb16912\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/PublicCompany\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/concept\u003e and \u003cconcept id=\"9e714df6-b0de-3dc0-b0b6-a7c32f66cf48\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/PublicCompany\"\u003eBaidu\u003c/concept\u003e, which are experimenting with mobile and desktop applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tech world is in the grip of an “AI spring”, says Oren Etzioni, head of the artificial intelligence research institute backed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Of all the new fronts this has opened up, the development of virtual assistants has become “one of the most exciting,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe consequences will stretch far beyond the ability to speak a question into your smartphone and get an immediate answer, or to have warnings about heavy traffic “pushed” to you at the time you normally leave for work. If the virtual assistants catch on, they are likely to take over many of the decisions that litter everyday life as they try to anticipate their users’ needs.

But it also served as a demonstration of the limits of the technology, as users quickly found that the system could only handle certain types of query.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The industry is still suffering from the hangover from the Siri let-down,” says Tim Tuttle, chief executive of Expect Labs, a company that makes a voice-activated assistant that can be used to power other companies’ applications. He and other experts in the field say that the technology has come a long way in a short space of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVirtual assistants rely on a number of different technologies. One involves speech recognition. Google says it has reduced the error rate for recognising words in its own mobile app to less than 8 per cent — a level at which it says the service has become a practical alternative to entering text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApple has also made considerable headway in overcoming the early disappointment by adding more capabilities to Siri and helping users better understand what it can and cannot do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second front has involved the predictive technology for anticipating what a user will want to know next. This draws on contextual data — aspects such as the location and time of day — as well as personal information. Knowing what other people have found useful is also valuable, says Aparna Chennapragada, a director of product management for Google’s mobile app: “For most people in your situation, what are the top five things you need?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tech companies do not release much information about the extent to which the virtual assistants are catching on. But what there is suggests that users are starting to show interest — even though, as Mr Etzioni cautions, it is probably too early to call it “an inflection point” for the technology. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChinese search company Baidu, for instance, puts the proportion of its searches that are conducted by voice at nearly 10 per cent. And Google says the number of times its users spoke a search query into their smartphones doubled last year, though it does not disclose a figure. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pick-up in use has some predicting that it will not be long before talking to gadgets becomes second nature — particularly as computer intelligence spreads to many new types of device where entering text is impractical, from \u003ccontent id=\"bbea6a02-ab92-11e4-8070-00144feab7de\" title=\"Google hopes all-or-nothing bet on robot cars will pay off soon - FT.com\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003esmartwatches to televisions and cars\u003c/content\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoice interactions like these “will be the gateway for all applications and the way into everything,” says Mr Tuttle.

His company’s technology is already being used to help TV viewers search through video-on-demand services and will soon be embedded in cars, whose makers he describes as loath to surrender their customers to Google and Apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as ways of interacting with smartphones and the many new devices of the “internet of things” change, that kind of brand loyalty may start to erode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Etzioni describes the kind of instruction that the next generation of personal assistants will be asked to handle: “Book me a table for three in an excellent restaurant downtown with easy parking.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo fulfil that desire, the technology would need not only a high level of natural language recognition, but the ability to draw information from different services (a restaurant review site, a maps app) and issue instructions through a reservation system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis kind of “more sophisticated service composition” could start to appear on smartphones in a little more than a year from now, he adds.

Your refrigerator can be intelligent. Your phone can be intelligent.” As a result, there will be no need to find an app, tap to open it and search inside for what you need: “If you need something, you will simply ask for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many ideas in tech, this combining of services on the fly like this is not new. At the height of the last tech boom, Microsoft imagined achieving something similar with a proprietary technology it called Hailstorm. The idea, coming at the height of the company’s power, terrified many in the tech world, who saw it as a way to force others to accept Microsoft’s terms of trade for all digital interactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutsiders such as Mr Etzioni now credit the software company with having developed a more open view of the world. “It’s an underdog thing — we’re a little bit more humbled than Microsoft was in the past,” says Mr Ash. “Cortana is not disruptive from the point of view of services,” he adds, but is designed to act as an open platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePulling in data\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terms on which app makers would allow their services to interact have yet to be determined, but the first elements of the technology to make this possible are starting to emerge. Last month, Google released an experimental API that lets other companies insert their own content into its Google Now service, so that their information can also be “pushed” at users when it is most likely to be needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the big tech companies are also working on methods for “deep linking” content inside standalone apps to make it possible to automatically find — and use — the information in other contexts. This may not turn the world of closed apps into the wide-open world of the hyperlinked web, but it still points to a time when the walls between apps will start to break down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this new world, information would flow continuously, reflecting the nature of computing when users are surrounded by always-connected devices, says Google’s Ms Chennapragada: the idea of opening a web page to read something would feel very old-fashioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeding the process would be new types of real-time and “actionable” information — the kind that helps virtual assistants make quick decisions as they assume more of their users’ everyday tasks. Offering up the right nugget of information or the right offer at the right time will be key to oiling the wheels of this new economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor many publishers and ecommerce companies this would be a very different world, requiring entirely new methods to reach customers. But if the Cortanas and Siris end up ruling the digital roost, they are likely to have little choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e","brands":[{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"}],"byline":"Richard Waters","canBeDistributed":"yes","canBeSyndicated":"yes","comments":{"enabled":true},"contentPackage":null,"copyright":null,"description":null,"editorialDesk":"/FT/Feats","externalBinaryUrl":null,"firstPublishedDate":"2015-02-22T19:18:25.000Z","identifiers":[{"authority":"http://api.ft.com/system/FTCOM-METHODE","identifierValue":"4b380a33-9aa8-4267-9062-90aa1ffa6ac0"}],"internalBinaryUrl":null,"lastModified":"2018-04-04T12:58:28.791Z","mainImage":"d87a58ce-b940-11e4-0690-978e959e1c97","masterSource":null,"mediaType":null,"members":null,"pixelHeight":null,"pixelWidth":null,"publishReference":"SYNTHETIC-REQ-MONdbaea63c-266b-46ba-bbd4-c078c382beaf","publishedDate":"2015-02-22T19:18:25.000Z","rightsGroup":null,"standfirst":"Technology companies race to develop the dominant ‘virtual assistant’","standout":{"editorsChoice":false,"exclusive":false,"scoop":false},"storyPackage":null,"title":"Artificial intelligence: A virtual assistant for life","type":"Article","uuid":"4b380a33-9aa8-4267-9062-90aa1ffa6ac0","webUrl":null},"metadata":[{"thing":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/3adcfb11-b562-368d-8a55-7c24642cb481","prefLabel":"Oren Etzioni","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/person/Person"],"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/people/3adcfb11-b562-368d-8a55-7c24642cb481"}},{"thing":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/9e714df6-b0de-3dc0-b0b6-a7c32f66cf48","prefLabel":"Baidu Inc","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/organisation/Organisation","http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/Company","http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/PublicCompany"],"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/organisations/9e714df6-b0de-3dc0-b0b6-a7c32f66cf48"}},{"thing":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/177235c9-064e-3913-9414-db33bbcb5002","prefLabel":"Mitch H.

No action is likely, but expect the BoE to highlight its vigilance about the continued risk. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e","brands":[{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"}],"byline":"Chris Giles, Economics Editor","canBeDistributed":"yes","canBeSyndicated":"yes","comments":{"enabled":true},"contentPackage":null,"copyright":null,"description":null,"editorialDesk":"/FT/WorldNews","externalBinaryUrl":null,"firstPublishedDate":"2017-06-27T04:05:37.000Z","identifiers":[{"authority":"http://api.ft.com/system/FTCOM-METHODE","identifierValue":"6b526228-5a83-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b"}],"internalBinaryUrl":null,"lastModified":"2018-04-04T12:58:41.867Z","mainImage":"db728cfe-5a92-11e7-2b35-7545c1789969","masterSource":null,"mediaType":null,"members":null,"pixelHeight":null,"pixelWidth":null,"publishReference":"republish_-6cd4cd6b-39ae-4326-87f6-b2edf4ad2419_carousel_1522846717","publishedDate":"2017-06-27T04:05:37.000Z","rightsGroup":null,"standfirst":"Emergency support for banks and consumer credit central to BoE update","standout":{"editorsChoice":false,"exclusive":false,"scoop":false},"storyPackage":null,"title":"UK financial stability report: five things to watch","type":"Article","uuid":"6b526228-5a83-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b","webUrl":null},"metadata":[{"thing":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/9268d10e-8e24-3dd7-b873-14c2789f382b","prefLabel":"Corporate Finance","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/Classification","http://www.ft.com/ontology/Subject"],"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/isClassifiedBy","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/things/9268d10e-8e24-3dd7-b873-14c2789f382b"}},{"thing":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/36a5ec7f-c074-38fe-866e-b3fc8faf167f","prefLabel":"Bank of England","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/organisation/Organisation"],"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/about","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/organisations/36a5ec7f-c074-38fe-866e-b3fc8faf167f"}},{"thing":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/f4be3653-cd9f-3e1d-b9af-d504a85b226a","prefLabel":"Financial Policy Committee","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/organisation/Organisation"],"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/majorMentions","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/organisations/f4be3653-cd9f-3e1d-b9af-d504a85b226a"}},{"thing":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/9b40e89c-e87b-3d4f-b72c-2cf7511d2146","prefLabel":"News","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/Classification","http://www.ft.com/ontology/Genre"],"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/isClassifiedBy","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/things/9b40e89c-e87b-3d4f-b72c-2cf7511d2146"}},{"thing":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/8e2e0dd7-ef14-3811-a2fe-ee576ed9f422","prefLabel":"General News","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/Classification","http://www.ft.com/ontology/Subject"],"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/isClassifiedBy","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/things/8e2e0dd7-ef14-3811-a2fe-ee576ed9f422"}},{"thing":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/6cc4c4ed-ef61-4c71-a5bb-f454fb5010a8","prefLabel":"UK business \u0026 economy","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/Topic"],"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/isPrimarilyClassifiedBy","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/things/6cc4c4ed-ef61-4c71-a5bb-f454fb5010a8"}},{"thing":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/a890a2fc-946b-3f99-bd9c-5ffd0c95ab4e","prefLabel":"Mortgages \u0026 Mortgage Rates","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/Classification","http://www.ft.com/ontology/Subject"],"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/isClassifiedBy","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/things/a890a2fc-946b-3f99-bd9c-5ffd0c95ab4e"}},{"thing":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/843f6641-22a8-3163-aa9d-b70909b46a83","prefLabel":"Mark J.

He’ll be the first American to get the gig. The news was announced on Sunday by Mr Wang via Instagram, which was seen as very cool, while at Coachella, which is even more cool. The message being, of course, that he is just cool, and this project is going to be super-cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept it always seems to me the appeal of the H\u0026amp;M collaborations was they took names that weren’t cool – they were haute, and generally unreachable – and it was the combination of unlikely bedfellows (the high street and the high fashion) that was actually the cool part. This one seems to indicate a change in strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, think about the names that preceded Mr Wang most successfully: Alber Elbaz of Lanvin; Karl Lagerfeld; Jimmy Choo; Comme des Garçons; Versace; Marni; Stella McCartney; Maison Martin Margiela. All of them seen as very inaccessible, either because of their prices or their aesthetics, to most consumers. Even Isabel Marant, who has made a name for herself on the upper edges of the French contemporary market, was relatively inaccessible to most shoppers outside of that country, and hence had an edge of get-it-quick-while-you-can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Wang, however, both because of his very successful and more accessible \u003ca href=\"http://www.alexanderwang.com/shop/womens//t-by-alexander-wang/all/\"\u003eT by Alexander Wang\u003c/a\u003e line, and his very smiley and outgoing personality, is much less of an unknown and elitist quantity. Sure, for the past three seasons he has designed for \u003ca href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/2012/12/03/wang-officially-moves-to-balenciaga-more-than-doubles-workload/\"\u003eBalenciaga\u003c/a\u003e, but that’s not really enough to have established him in the thin-air regions of fashion; he may well get there, but it has not happened yet. And anyway, this isn’t Balenciaga for H\u0026amp;M, it’s Wang – which is an important difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s a more populist choice, both in terms of name recognition and aesthetic, than those that came before. He has less mystique – though it is not to say his collection won’t sell very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tee at T, for example, still costs about $100, and a cotton-ribbed dress is $450, so presumably whatever he does for H\u0026amp;M will be cheaper, which means the Wang-ettes will be waiting. Plus, it also positions Mr Wang – between Balenciaga, his own line, and T – as the Karl Lagerfeld (aka the most polymorphous designer) of his generation. Between that, and the marketing muscle that comes with H\u0026amp;M, you can see the definite upside for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor H\u0026amp;M, though, while Mr Wang’s aura may give them a new veneer of buzz, it may not do what some of their other collaborations have done, which is entice entirely new consumers, who are drawn by the chance to get a piece of a couture brand, through their doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, it feels less like a chance to buy the dream than an opportunity to enter an already open door at a lower price point.

The message being, of course, that he is just cool, and this project is going to be super-cool. Except it always seems to me the appeal of the H\u0026amp;M collaborations was they took names that weren’t cool – they were haute, and generally unreachable – and it was the combination of unlikely bedfellows (the high street and the high fashion) that was actually the cool part.

He said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“No one in their right mind would take on a job in which your success is judged by your success in fiscal forecasts”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe OBR is not alone in this plight. Members of the Monetary Policy Committee take interest rate decisions which are predicated on the Bank of England’s forecasts. But in having a decision as well as a forecast, the MPC is always able to claim that it took the right decision based on the information available at the time, which takes the focus away from its often poor forecasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for the communication surrounding errors. The origination of forecast errors is more important.

The arguments in favor of such a policy hinge on a clear understanding on the part of the public that the central bank will tolerate increased inflation only temporarily–say, for a few years once the economy has recovered–before returning to the original inflation target in the long term. In standard theoretical model environments, long-run inflation expectations are perfectly anchored. In reality, however, the anchoring of inflation expectations has been a hard-won achievement of monetary policy over the past few decades, and we should not take this stability for granted. Models are by their nature only a stylized representation of reality, and a policy of achieving “temporarily” higher inflation over the medium term would run the risk of altering inflation expectations beyond the horizon that is desirable.

The arguments in favor of such a policy hinge on a clear understanding on the part of the public that the central bank will tolerate increased inflation only temporarily–say, for a few years once the economy has recovered–before returning to the original inflation target in the long term. In standard theoretical model environments, long-run inflation expectations are perfectly anchored. In reality, however, the anchoring of inflation expectations has been a hard-won achievement of monetary policy over the past few decades, and we should not take this stability for granted. Models are by their nature only a stylized representation of reality, and a policy of achieving “temporarily” higher inflation over the medium term would run the risk of altering inflation expectations beyond the horizon that is desirable.

I think they may look more carefully at the country, and perhaps even explore options, but my guess is they will remain wary, at least when it comes to the kinds of brands that line the Avenues Montaigne and Montenapoleone. Here are some reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, there are the logistical challenges, which are meaningful. Second, last winter I was having a conversation with the CEO of an enormously successful international accessory brand that will remain nameless, and the subject of \u003ca href=\"http://www.ft.com/topics/places/Nigeria\"\u003eNigeria\u003c/a\u003e came up, but when I asked about it, he shook his head. Aside from systemic factors, he said he just didn’t feel comfortable with where a lot of the money was coming from. It was partly, he said, a moral decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/files/2014/04/chanel-globe.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/files/2014/04/chanel-globe-272x180.jpg\" width=\"272\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, it would be completely fair to roll your eyes at this and point out morals didn’t stop luxury from running headlong into Russia or any number of other countries (including the US, back in the days when the robber barons ruled the economy); that often in history the cycle of wealth goes from the more oblique to the acceptable in origin, and luxury is, in fact, a crucial part of that cycle, but nevertheless, I believed him. Which was interesting. And I don’t think he’s the only one with such concerns, as the globe (above) at the Chanel show in March 2013 illustrating all its stores around the world via little lights, demonstrated: Africa was, in their terms, the dark continent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuxury is, after all, obsessed with its image. And this is, in some ways, a question of image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, that GDP number is a big figure. And the population of Nigeria – 169m – is also a big number. So it will be interesting to see which impulse wins out: the rush to numbers or the protection of image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is clearly a struggle going on, as we have been trying to get an executive to join our \u003ca href=\"http://www.ftbusinessofluxury.com/ehome/index.php?eventid=75766\u0026amp;\"\u003eBusiness of Luxury summit\u003c/a\u003e, which is taking place next month in Mexico City and will look at markets of the future (I encourage everyone to sign up and come – it’s going to be great), to talk specifically about this issue and guess what: they are all scared. No one wants to commit publicly, because, I venture to guess, they can’t quite decide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, luxury also has that safety-in-number thing – as consultant Robert Burke once told me, for an industry obsessed with creativity, it is remarkably “conservative” – so if a few more stores enter the market the whole thing will probably tip, and they will all start to look for space. In the end, competitive instinct may be the deciding factor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, however, anyone else have any thoughts? Maybe Paddy Power should start giving odds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e","brands":[{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/13006c72-7d1b-47a0-96fe-d1ad1f12de9f"},{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"}],"byline":"Vanessa Friedman","canBeDistributed":"yes","canBeSyndicated":"verify","comments":{"enabled":true},"description":null,"externalBinaryUrl":null,"firstPublishedDate":"2014-04-07T11:34:53.000Z","identifiers":[{"authority":"http://api.ft.com/system/FT-LABS-WP-1-106","identifierValue":"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/2014/04/07/will-luxury-rush-to-nigeria-now/"},{"authority":"http://api.ft.com/system/FT-LABS-WP-1-106","identifierValue":"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/?p=90292"}],"internalBinaryUrl":null,"lastModified":"2018-04-04T12:58:55.031Z","mainImage":null,"mediaType":null,"members":null,"opening":"\u003cbody\u003e\u003cp\u003eBig (literally) news today in the FT that yesterday, thanks to a government recalculation, Nigeria’s GDP has not become the biggest in Africa, and the 26th biggest in the world, valued at $509bn.

So what are we looking forward to? Four major debuts are taking place this week – more new names at old houses than in any other city. Here are the big ones to watch:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. \u003ca href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/e42340d8-4578-11e3-b98b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2uGqgvSEX\"\u003eNicolas Ghesquière’\u003c/a\u003es debut for Louis Vuitton. That’s him, left, with Kristin Stewart, and this is the biggie, the one everyone is waiting for. It is also on the last day, March 5, which will a) keep everyone in the city until the dire end, a very nice commercial twist for Paris Fashion Week; and b) keep anticipation at a boil. This is partly because of the behind-the-scenes psychodrama surrounding his appointment, and the Montague and Capulet relationship between LVMH and his former employer, Kering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, however, what fascinates me is whether he will be able to pull off a credible ready-to-wear collection in sales terms. Vuitton always treated former artistic director Marc Jacobs’ collections as more show pieces, and less commercial endeavours, and they were only sold in a few select LV stores. So while he transformed Vuitton into a fashion brand image-wise, it wasn’t really a fashion brand revenue-wise. Now word is strategic importance is being placed on the clothes. Let’s see what that means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/files/2014/02/JW-Anderson-award1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"398\" src=\"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/files/2014/02/JW-Anderson-award1-272x398.jpg\" width=\"272\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. \u003ca href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/2013/09/26/the-jw-anderson-loewe-deal-and-the-shifting-balance-of-power/\"\u003eJonathan Anderson\u003c/a\u003e’s debut for Loewe. When gender-bending YBD Jonathan Anderson (aka JW Anderson, left) was named creative director of Loewe, following Stuart Vevers, the fashion world was surprised, Loewe being touted as the “Hermes” (read: conservative high-luxury brand) of Spain, and Mr Anderson being something of an agent provocateur in Britain. It also marked Delphine Arnault’s first big young designer move. This will be the first test of whether it was a smart move, or one that generated a lot of sound and fury and maybe confused consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. What’s afoot at Vionnet. Hussein Chalayan has already done one demi-\u003ca href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/5b724f08-8412-11e3-9903-00144feab7de.html#slide0\"\u003ecouture show\u003c/a\u003e for the brand that was a little questionable, but he had only been in place for a few weeks, and there’s no doubting his extraordinary talent. Now it will be interesting to see how that collection relates to the ready-to-wear offerings from owner and former designer \u003ca href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/b011a812-d8da-11e2-84fa-00144feab7de.html\"\u003eGoga Ashkenazi\u003c/a\u003e later this week – if at all. Can it really be possible for a house to have such very different designers for different lines, and still create a consistent and complimentary brand aesthetic? We’ll soon find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6c77adb2-dddb-11dd-87dc-000077b07658.html\"\u003eHussein Chalayan\u003c/a\u003e’s debut for Vionnet. OK, he did already have one \u003ca href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/5b724f08-8412-11e3-9903-00144feab7de.html#slide0\"\u003ecouture show\u003c/a\u003e for the brand that was a little questionable, but he had only been in place for a few weeks, and there’s no doubting his extraordinary talent. Now he’s had a chance to properly get a team in place and his thoughts organised, so this will be the first real example of his “vision” for the brand, and how much freedom he is being given – or not – by owner and former designer \u003ca href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/b011a812-d8da-11e2-84fa-00144feab7de.html\"\u003eGoga Ashkenazi.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Yiqing Yin’s debut at Leonard. The venerable fashion name has pretty much fallen off the fashion map in recent seasons. Will the buzz around this young French-Chinese designer (which, lets face it, partly has to do with the buzz around China, even though she left that country when she was four) be enough to put it back on? Or even enough to get people back into seats?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll be there any way (at all of them), so I’ll report back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, a few other things to think about: will all the celebrities have deserted Paris because of the weekend’s Oscars? Presumably we won’t see Jennifer Lawrence at Dior on Friday, though I’m pretty sure she will be IN Dior on Sunday.

And how do we work to turn ill-defined talk of \u003ccontent id=\"eebff700-5444-11e7-9fed-c19e2700005f\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003esoftness\u003c/content\u003e into something concrete and politically acceptable both in Britain and Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first softening that has to happen straightaway concerns posture: clear acceptance that no deal would be a catastrophic failure rather than an assertion of UK confidence and machismo; a constructive tone on money and \u003ccontent id=\"e86d81f8-5712-11e7-80b6-9bfa4c1f83d2\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003eEU citizens’ rights \u003c/content\u003ethat understands why a fair deal on these things matters as much to the union as it does to the UK; no more bluster about regulatory competition between us and the continent. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much will be built on trust between the two sides, this tone cannot be more important. Flirting with unsustainable tough talk for domestic consumption will backfire — they read our newspapers. But the real issue is how to put fresh focus on an agreement that respects the will of UK voters while mitigating the job losses and sacrifice in living standards. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ccontent id=\"a6b9c062-dca8-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003eMrs May \u003c/content\u003ecalled for a deep and comprehensive free-trade agreement. \nBut the UK prime minister is not going to get it with her existing red lines, especially for regulated services. It would have to include a willingness by the UK to consider forms of regulatory alignment and enforcement with the EU, for example in finance and broadcasting, to maintain our privileged market access. Tying our standards to EU ones in return for market access is the essence of an intelligent debate about where regulatory autonomy and access to our largest market need to be balanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe government should put renewed emphasis on the hints in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-governments-negotiating-objectives-for-exiting-the-eu-pm-speech\" title=\"www.gov.uk\"\u003eLancaster House speech\u003c/a\u003e that the UK wants to remain closely aligned with the EU in research, aviation policy and security. We should include \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/3cf1fba7-105b-3766-a23a-466154169657\"\u003eEuratom\u003c/a\u003e in this. We should be clear that we see ourselves caucusing with the EU on everything from climate change and multi-\u003cbr/\u003elateralism in trade policy to global financial standards. We should maintain unified capital markets, even if that means binding the UK into close supervisory co-operation with the EU. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe government should proactively argue that taking back control of migration policy does not mean closing the door to visa free travel or ending an open approach to European citizens who want to work in the UK where the labour market needs them. Rejecting the principle of freedom of movement has to give way to a discussion about how it would work in practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ccontent data-embedded=\"true\" id=\"a8a4e800-5748-11e7-1ed0-0c60966b289b\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\"\u003e\u003c/content\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prime minister needs to deliver a Lancaster House Mark 2. Staying in the customs union is important, although originally ruled out in January in order to signal new UK autonomy in trade policy. There is no point in pretending this does not involve compromising the UK’s ability to set its own external tariffs — and by implication its ability to negotiate independent trade deals on goods. But meaningful trade deals of this kind will be hard to achieve and are, in any case, only one part of what an autonomous trade policy means. It would also mean compromise in aligning with EU product standards and in a common approach to industrial subsidies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut these compromises need to be weighed against the benefits: eliminating tariffs with our largest market; no origin requirements for goods and components. Even aligning with EU standards has the upside of creating a level playing field in which UK firms can rely on mutual recognition in the single market. Staying in the customs union, or, to a greater extent in the single market via something like EEA membership, would mean losing some control over EU rules but retaining all the associated trade benefits of the single market. There is no simple answer here. But there is a necessary debate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ccontent data-embedded=\"true\" id=\"b7569fd8-97f5-479e-8fa7-585d95ed49a5\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Video\"\u003e\u003c/content\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it is important to recognise that without such compromises a hard Brexit means leaving the EU without transitional arrangements and minus the clear prospect of a deep and comprehensive trade agreement. Such a cliff edge, and without the legal continuity provided by the Great Repeal Bill, would be a disaster. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distinction between hard and soft Brexits has always been an elastic concept. It understates how much could be possible if the accent was put on innovative policy approaches, with a large injection of pragmatism and compromise, and a wider view of the UK’s role as an EU partner. Global Britain is all well and good. It is time to be a whole lot clearer about what a European Britain will look like in the future.    \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe writer is a former UK cabinet minister and EU trade commissioner\u003c/em\u003e   \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJohn Redwood\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the British people voted for \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/brexit\"\u003eBrexit\u003c/a\u003e they voted to take back control. They knew exactly what they wanted. The official Leave campaign stuck to the same vision throughout. We want control of our laws, our money and our borders. When Britain leaves the EU in 20 months’ time, that is what we will have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccontent id=\"0c5c74bc-151e-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003eProminent members of the Leave campaign\u003c/content\u003e stated that leaving the EU meant leaving the single market and customs union too, and stopping all contributions to the bloc’s budget once out. While \u003ccontent id=\"3756dc5a-558e-11e7-9fed-c19e2700005f\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003ePhilip Hammond\u003c/content\u003e, the chancellor, is right to say that people did not vote to be worse off, those of us who voted Leave wish the UK to agree good terms with its neighbours and friends in the EU for a positive and mutually beneficial relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis should include tariff-free trade with no new harmful barriers, continuing co-operation on security and intelligence, mutual defence through Nato, and many investment, academic and cultural links. The UK offers a lot and is happy to carry on with these contributions to the greater good. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce out of the EU, Britain will regain its full voice and vote on international standards and trade bodies, giving it more of a say. Of course, the UK will no longer have a seat at the table when the EU interprets the decisions taken by global institutions for its internal market. British exporters will need to comply with EU rules when selling into the single market, just as today they have to accept US rules when selling into the American market. Once out of the EU, Britain will have two advantages: it can help shape the global standards that lie behind the EU ones, and it will not need to apply the EU variants to domestic and non-EU trade, as we do at the moment, if that is unhelpful to business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome say there is no way the EU will allow tariff-free trade after Britain leaves. If the UK has to go over to World Trade Organization terms because there is no special trade deal, the EU will lose out. The UK does not sell much that would be subject to high tariffs, whereas EU farm exports would be badly hit. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ccontent data-embedded=\"true\" id=\"ba6708ac-5748-11e7-1ed0-0c60966b289b\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\"\u003e\u003c/content\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the main problems with Britain’s membership of the EU has been the continuing and huge balance of trade deficit we have run with the rest of the bloc, £70bn last year. Given the fact that we run a \u003ca href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7851\"\u003esurplus with the rest of the world\u003c/a\u003e, it implies there is something about EU rules and trade arrangements that are unhelpful to us. Just look at the way the common agricultural policy has damaged British farming and turned the UK into a massive importer of EU food. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr look at the way the common fisheries policy has turned a nation with one of the richest fishing grounds in the world into a heavy net importer of fish. Out of the EU Britain can have a fishing policy that is kinder to our fish and fishermen. If the EU decides on high tariffs for food, the impact on prices can be cushioned by removing tariffs from agricultural products we cannot grow for ourselves from elsewhere in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also the problem of too many people coming to Britain from the EU to look for low-paid jobs. We need to do better at training and educating people already settled in the UK to do the jobs that need doing, and to help business raise the skill and pay levels as we do so. Britain has always made clear that a new migration policy will welcome anyone with the skills and educational qualifications we seek, and anyone coming in on a company transfer who is needed. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no “cliff edge” ahead. The next 20 months should be used by both sides in the Brexit negotiations to ensure exports run smoothly after we leave. Some say, for example, that planes will not fly to Paris from London for want of an air services agreement on the day Britain departs the EU. But many countries around the world lack such agreements with others, yet their planes fly with landing rights granted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK can agree landing rights even if the EU fails to agree a full air services agreement with us. There is plenty of time to make the customs documentation work for the new relationship. If all else fails and we are left with WTO rules, then we know how that works as that is what drives all our non-EU trade today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusiness should therefore get behind the government negotiators who want to sort out these matters in a timely way. It should understand that Britain can be better off out, as it will at last draw up policies for deeply damaged sectors like fishing and farming where we currently import too much thanks to EU rules. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe EU is bound by article 21 of its own\u003ca href=\"http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-5-general-provisions-on-the-unions-external-action-and-specific-provisions/chapter-1-general-provisions-on-the-unions-external-action/101-article-10a.html\"\u003e treaty\u003c/a\u003e to have positive and friendly relationships with neighbouring states based on the pursuit of trade and prosperity.

One ‘softer’ than set out in Theresa May’s Lancaster House speech in January? Almost certainly, as \u003ca href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4614492/Wounded-knees-PM-faces-civil-war.html\"\u003epolls\u003c/a\u003e now show. But what does that mean?

Flirting with unsustainable tough talk for domestic consumption will backfire — they read our newspapers. But the real issue is how to put fresh focus on an agreement that respects the will of UK voters while mitigating the job losses and sacrifice in living standards. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ccontent id=\"a6b9c062-dca8-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003eMrs May \u003c/content\u003ecalled for a deep and comprehensive free-trade agreement. \nBut the UK prime minister is not going to get it with her existing red lines, especially for regulated services. It would have to include a willingness by the UK to consider forms of regulatory alignment and enforcement with the EU, for example in finance and broadcasting, to maintain our privileged market access. Tying our standards to EU ones in return for market access is the essence of an intelligent debate about where regulatory autonomy and access to our largest market need to be balanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe government should put renewed emphasis on the hints in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-governments-negotiating-objectives-for-exiting-the-eu-pm-speech\" title=\"www.gov.uk\"\u003eLancaster House speech\u003c/a\u003e that the UK wants to remain closely aligned with the EU in research, aviation policy and security. We should include \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/3cf1fba7-105b-3766-a23a-466154169657\"\u003eEuratom\u003c/a\u003e in this. We should be clear that we see ourselves caucusing with the EU on everything from climate change and multi-\u003cbr/\u003elateralism in trade policy to global financial standards. We should maintain unified capital markets, even if that means binding the UK into close supervisory co-operation with the EU. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe government should proactively argue that taking back control of migration policy does not mean closing the door to visa free travel or ending an open approach to European citizens who want to work in the UK where the labour market needs them. Rejecting the principle of freedom of movement has to give way to a discussion about how it would work in practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ccontent data-embedded=\"true\" id=\"a8a4e800-5748-11e7-1ed0-0c60966b289b\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\"\u003e\u003c/content\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prime minister needs to deliver a Lancaster House Mark 2. Staying in the customs union is important, although originally ruled out in January in order to signal new UK autonomy in trade policy. There is no point in pretending this does not involve compromising the UK’s ability to set its own external tariffs — and by implication its ability to negotiate independent trade deals on goods. But meaningful trade deals of this kind will be hard to achieve and are, in any case, only one part of what an autonomous trade policy means. It would also mean compromise in aligning with EU product standards and in a common approach to industrial subsidies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut these compromises need to be weighed against the benefits: eliminating tariffs with our largest market; no origin requirements for goods and components. Even aligning with EU standards has the upside of creating a level playing field in which UK firms can rely on mutual recognition in the single market. Staying in the customs union, or, to a greater extent in the single market via something like EEA membership, would mean losing some control over EU rules but retaining all the associated trade benefits of the single market. There is no simple answer here. But there is a necessary debate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ccontent data-embedded=\"true\" id=\"b7569fd8-97f5-479e-8fa7-585d95ed49a5\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Video\"\u003e\u003c/content\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it is important to recognise that without such compromises a hard Brexit means leaving the EU without transitional arrangements and minus the clear prospect of a deep and comprehensive trade agreement. Such a cliff edge, and without the legal continuity provided by the Great Repeal Bill, would be a disaster. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distinction between hard and soft Brexits has always been an elastic concept. It understates how much could be possible if the accent was put on innovative policy approaches, with a large injection of pragmatism and compromise, and a wider view of the UK’s role as an EU partner. Global Britain is all well and good. It is time to be a whole lot clearer about what a European Britain will look like in the future.    \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe writer is a former UK cabinet minister and EU trade commissioner\u003c/em\u003e   \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJohn Redwood\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the British people voted for \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/brexit\"\u003eBrexit\u003c/a\u003e they voted to take back control. They knew exactly what they wanted. The official Leave campaign stuck to the same vision throughout. We want control of our laws, our money and our borders. When Britain leaves the EU in 20 months’ time, that is what we will have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccontent id=\"0c5c74bc-151e-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003eProminent members of the Leave campaign\u003c/content\u003e stated that leaving the EU meant leaving the single market and customs union too, and stopping all contributions to the bloc’s budget once out. While \u003ccontent id=\"3756dc5a-558e-11e7-9fed-c19e2700005f\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003ePhilip Hammond\u003c/content\u003e, the chancellor, is right to say that people did not vote to be worse off, those of us who voted Leave wish the UK to agree good terms with its neighbours and friends in the EU for a positive and mutually beneficial relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis should include tariff-free trade with no new harmful barriers, continuing co-operation on security and intelligence, mutual defence through Nato, and many investment, academic and cultural links. The UK offers a lot and is happy to carry on with these contributions to the greater good. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce out of the EU, Britain will regain its full voice and vote on international standards and trade bodies, giving it more of a say. Of course, the UK will no longer have a seat at the table when the EU interprets the decisions taken by global institutions for its internal market. British exporters will need to comply with EU rules when selling into the single market, just as today they have to accept US rules when selling into the American market. Once out of the EU, Britain will have two advantages: it can help shape the global standards that lie behind the EU ones, and it will not need to apply the EU variants to domestic and non-EU trade, as we do at the moment, if that is unhelpful to business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome say there is no way the EU will allow tariff-free trade after Britain leaves. If the UK has to go over to World Trade Organization terms because there is no special trade deal, the EU will lose out. The UK does not sell much that would be subject to high tariffs, whereas EU farm exports would be badly hit. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ccontent data-embedded=\"true\" id=\"ba6708ac-5748-11e7-1ed0-0c60966b289b\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\"\u003e\u003c/content\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the main problems with Britain’s membership of the EU has been the continuing and huge balance of trade deficit we have run with the rest of the bloc, £70bn last year. Given the fact that we run a \u003ca href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7851\"\u003esurplus with the rest of the world\u003c/a\u003e, it implies there is something about EU rules and trade arrangements that are unhelpful to us. Just look at the way the common agricultural policy has damaged British farming and turned the UK into a massive importer of EU food. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr look at the way the common fisheries policy has turned a nation with one of the richest fishing grounds in the world into a heavy net importer of fish. Out of the EU Britain can have a fishing policy that is kinder to our fish and fishermen. If the EU decides on high tariffs for food, the impact on prices can be cushioned by removing tariffs from agricultural products we cannot grow for ourselves from elsewhere in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also the problem of too many people coming to Britain from the EU to look for low-paid jobs. We need to do better at training and educating people already settled in the UK to do the jobs that need doing, and to help business raise the skill and pay levels as we do so. Britain has always made clear that a new migration policy will welcome anyone with the skills and educational qualifications we seek, and anyone coming in on a company transfer who is needed. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no “cliff edge” ahead. The next 20 months should be used by both sides in the Brexit negotiations to ensure exports run smoothly after we leave. Some say, for example, that planes will not fly to Paris from London for want of an air services agreement on the day Britain departs the EU. But many countries around the world lack such agreements with others, yet their planes fly with landing rights granted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK can agree landing rights even if the EU fails to agree a full air services agreement with us. There is plenty of time to make the customs documentation work for the new relationship. If all else fails and we are left with WTO rules, then we know how that works as that is what drives all our non-EU trade today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusiness should therefore get behind the government negotiators who want to sort out these matters in a timely way. It should understand that Britain can be better off out, as it will at last draw up policies for deeply damaged sectors like fishing and farming where we currently import too much thanks to EU rules. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe EU is bound by article 21 of its own\u003ca href=\"http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-5-general-provisions-on-the-unions-external-action-and-specific-provisions/chapter-1-general-provisions-on-the-unions-external-action/101-article-10a.html\"\u003e treaty\u003c/a\u003e to have positive and friendly relationships with neighbouring states based on the pursuit of trade and prosperity. Obeying that makes sense for the EU and for Britain.    \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe writer is Conservative member of parliament for Wokingham\u003c/em\u003e

Warren Buffett is betting that Americans will step away from their sofas and venture into the real world. On Monday an affiliate of Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway took a 10 per cent stake, costing less than $400m, in an obscure US property owner, Store Capital. The real estate investment trust (Reit) owns freestanding properties that lease space to companies specialising in “experiences” — AMC theatres, Cadence Education, O’Charley’s steakhouses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven a limited exposure to US retail has cast a pall over property owners such as Store, whose shares have fallen 30 per cent in the past year. Mr Buffett must believe that whatever the onslaught of Amazon, there are opportunities for careful investors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor many merchants, owning property is not worth the trouble. Reits such as Store continuously acquire property — often through sale-and-leaseback transactions with merchants — and become landlords. They charge modestly escalating rents and their \u003ccontent id=\"d0aa189e-7aed-11e6-ae24-f193b105145e\" title=\"Real estate gains independence on US stock market\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003etax-efficient structure \u003c/content\u003emeans that by paying virtually all their profits as dividends they are spared corporate-level taxes. With dividend yields greater than 5 per cent, Reits have prospered in a yield-starved world. Investors just have to hope they have a canny understanding of tenant risk. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile 80 per cent of Store’s revenue comes from outside retail, one customer, camping equipment seller Gander Mountain, recently filed for bankruptcy. The tenant only accounts for 2 per cent of Store’s rents collected, however. Store properties on average generate cash flow twice the size of the rent expense it charges indicating a significant cushion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA leverage-fuelled acquisition strategy brings its own risk. Store’s debt/ebitda ratio of 6 times is juicy. The risk is less about changing consumer habits. Mr Buffett should worry when the whole economy broadly turns down and consumers have less to spend from both their living rooms and the outdoors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEmail the

It was bound to happen – and it has happened everywhere. Anyone remember the Fiera in Milan, aka the Italian answer to the tents? Abandoned by brands. How about the much-ballyhooed venues in the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris? Ditto. It has been turned into a place for trade shows. As Narciso Rodriguez said when I discussed this with him, “I spend a lot of time trying to figure out my specific point of view, so it doesn’t really make sense for me to then show the collection in the same place as a bunch of other designers. It sort of defeats the purpose.” It’s the one reliable thing: like death and taxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/alexander-wang-moving-show-to-brooklyn-7361146\"\u003eAlexander Wang’s show\u003c/a\u003e on Saturday in Brooklyn is widely being held up as the ultimate example of this trend (OMG! An outer borough!), but it happened by accident – his usual venue was unavailable and he had to scramble to get another – and while they are putting the best spin on the situation (he’s a pioneer!) my guess is next season they will be back in Manhattan. Though not back in the tents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, students of history will thus know that fact is, no matter what happens with the next Great Shared Venue, \u003ca href=\"http://www.elle.com/news/fashion-style/nyfw-hudson-yards-move\"\u003eHudson Yards\u003c/a\u003e, at a certain point, designers are going to leave. Let’s just admit it, and spend our tax money in more productive ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFact 2: Every virtual brand wants a physical product\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as e-brands \u003ca href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/2012/11/30/in-fashion-digital-is-not-enough/\"\u003eBonobos, Warby Parker\u003c/a\u003e and Moda Operandi now have bricks and mortar “showrooms” (a store by another name) so customers can reach out and touch their products, so, too, e-ditorial outlets are turning to actual paper magazines. Today Net a Porter is finally launching their print product, \u003ca href=\"http://www.businessoffashion.com/2014/02/porter-magazine-net-a-porter.html\"\u003ePorter\u003c/a\u003e, with rumours that they may follow with a men’s title, and on Friday Editorialist, the New York-based luxury accessory and jewellery ecommerce/ezine, launches their print incarnation. I’m not entirely convinced it’s good business (though I do think when it comes to advertising in magazines, luxury brands like nice paper more than the web; the pictures just look better), but I do think it’s human nature: people want to hold what they make in their hands, otherwise it doesn’t feel real. So I expect more of it to happen, couched under the rubric Omni-channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFact 3: Weather has no effect on what people wear because of street style\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter seasons of covering NYFW in February, through all sorts of inclement weather, I have learnt that temporal reality has nothing to do with fashion footwear. Hence I expect the coming weekend snowstorm that has designers showing on Sunday biting their nails will have no effect at all on the shoes we see. This is being driven, as usual, by street style photographers: after all, how much better are your chances of being snapped if you march through a snowdrift in stilettos than in moon boots?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we wonder why the world thinks fashion people are nuts.

What an advertisement!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept it never quite works that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/files/2014/02/beyonce-super-bowl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"405\" src=\"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/files/2014/02/beyonce-super-bowl-272x405.jpg\" width=\"272\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider: last year, Rubin Singer, an NY-based young designer, created Beyonce’s elaborate leather lace bodysuit (left). Does anyone remember? Has his name recognition gone up? Not really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2012, Givenchy did the clothes for Madonna’s Super Bowl performance. Again, lots of trumpeting, little post-game news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFact is, people watch the Super Bowl for many reasons – nostalgia, kitsch, love of the game (though often, like Sunday night, it’s a terrible game) – but fashion is just not one of them. It’s not a night about clothes, or even the pop culture value of clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a brand dressed the players, or even the coaches, as they did in European football, it might be a different story. But no matter how much the half-time show gets promoted, it’s really just a footnote to the event, and the fashion is a footnote to the footnote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Saint Laurent saw this simply as a way to cement their relationship with an up-and-coming artist, in which case it was a meaningful investment in the future. Maybe they saw it as a way to reaffirm their relationship with the music world, after putting lots of musicians, albeit edgier ones than Mr Mars, in their ad campaigns. Maybe they saw it as a way to expand their customer base, given that Mr Slimane, the creative director of YSL, is famous for making his suiting silhouettes so skinny only a small percentage of the population can actually wear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of those are possible, and legitimate, reasons to dress the Super Bowl show. But as a one-off event that will be seen round the world, like the Oscars red carpet or even the Director’s Guild Awards, and translate into exposure that will play and play? Every year, I think it’s a fumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e","brands":[{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/13006c72-7d1b-47a0-96fe-d1ad1f12de9f"},{"id":"http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"}],"byline":"Vanessa Friedman","canBeDistributed":"yes","canBeSyndicated":"verify","comments":{"enabled":true},"description":null,"externalBinaryUrl":null,"firstPublishedDate":"2014-02-03T12:26:03.000Z","identifiers":[{"authority":"http://api.ft.com/system/FT-LABS-WP-1-106","identifierValue":"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/2014/02/03/is-the-super-bowl-the-exception-to-the-red-carpet-rule-or-will-it-work-for-ysl/"},{"authority":"http://api.ft.com/system/FT-LABS-WP-1-106","identifierValue":"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/?p=84002"}],"internalBinaryUrl":null,"lastModified":"2018-04-04T12:59:13.030Z","mainImage":null,"mediaType":null,"members":null,"opening":"\u003cbody\u003e\u003cp\u003eConventional wisdom dictates that a spot in the Super Bowl (which is to say, an ad) is a highly desirable thing, given the game is watched by approximately 100 million people, give or take.

Warren Buffett is betting that Americans will step away from their sofas and venture into the real world. On Monday an affiliate of Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway took a 10 per cent stake, costing less than $400m, in an obscure US property owner, Store Capital. The real estate investment trust (Reit) owns freestanding properties that lease space to companies specialising in “experiences” — AMC theatres, Cadence Education, O’Charley’s steakhouses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven a limited exposure to US retail has cast a pall over property owners such as Store, whose shares have fallen 30 per cent in the past year. Mr Buffett must believe that whatever the onslaught of Amazon, there are opportunities for careful investors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor many merchants, owning property is not worth the trouble. Reits such as Store continuously acquire property — often through sale-and-leaseback transactions with merchants — and become landlords. They charge modestly escalating rents and their \u003ccontent id=\"d0aa189e-7aed-11e6-ae24-f193b105145e\" title=\"Real estate gains independence on US stock market\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\"\u003etax-efficient structure \u003c/content\u003emeans that by paying virtually all their profits as dividends they are spared corporate-level taxes. With dividend yields greater than 5 per cent, Reits have prospered in a yield-starved world. Investors just have to hope they have a canny understanding of tenant risk. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile 80 per cent of Store’s revenue comes from outside retail, one customer, camping equipment seller Gander Mountain, recently filed for bankruptcy. The tenant only accounts for 2 per cent of Store’s rents collected, however. Store properties on average generate cash flow twice the size of the rent expense it charges indicating a significant cushion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA leverage-fuelled acquisition strategy brings its own risk. Store’s debt/ebitda ratio of 6 times is juicy. The risk is less about changing consumer habits. Mr Buffett should worry when the whole economy broadly turns down and consumers have less to spend from both their living rooms and the outdoors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEmail the
